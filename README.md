# BitClout Frontend

This is the repository for the reference BitClout Angular app. It serves as an
interface that allows users to interact with the data on the BitClout blockchain.

## Development server

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

After proper configuration of `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`, run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use `npm run build_prod` for a production build.
